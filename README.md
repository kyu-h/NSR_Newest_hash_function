# NSR_Newest_hash_function
This project for matched reference log.
We will not develope SHA3 base code. We just get original code from Keccak Team.
If we have some time, we will change that base code on our own.

1. We will find SHA3 hash values and matched that values with NSR until April 25.
2. Make a HMAC which is SHA3 version until May 4.
3. Make a Hash_DRBG until MAY 16.
4. Make a HMAC_DRBG until MAY 23.
5. Make a PBKDF until MAY 30.
6. Make a HMAC_KDF until June 20.
